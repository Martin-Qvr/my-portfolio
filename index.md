### Selected projects in Data Science

[Named Entity Recognition for Posology extraction - NLP](/sample_page)
Implemented several NLP augmentation techniques on Posology data from anonymized hospital admission in France.
Explored techniques include (back translation, paraphrase generation, random deletion / random swapping, summarization, synonym generation)

We then use the augmented data to train a last layer on a transformers model ```CamembertForTokenClassification```[here](https://huggingface.co/camembert-base) from Huggingface's transformers library.

[Silo detection - McKinsey - computer vision](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)
Performing two different computer vision tasks on a satellite image dataset. First, classification of image to know whether they contain grain silos or not. Second image segmentation using U-Net like architecture to find where is the silo positioned in the image.
