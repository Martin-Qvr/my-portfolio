[Named Entity Recognition for Posology extraction - NLP](/sample_page)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>
Implemented several NLP augmentation techniques on Posology data from anonymized hospital admission in France.
Explored techniques include (back translation, paraphrase generation, random deletion / random swapping, summarization, synonym generation)

We then use the augmented data to train a last layer on a transformers model ```CamembertForTokenClassification```[here](https://huggingface.co/camembert-base) from Huggingface's transformers library.
